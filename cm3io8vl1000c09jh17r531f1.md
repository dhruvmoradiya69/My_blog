Welcome to Day 41 of our AWS journey! Yesterday, we explored launch templates and instances in EC2. Today, we‚Äôre diving into **Load Balancing**, a key concept for building scalable, resilient systems. This tutorial will guide you step-by-step in setting up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** using **AWS EC2** instances.

---

## What is Load Balancing?

Load Balancing ensures optimal resource utilization by distributing workloads across multiple servers. It plays a crucial role in improving the reliability, scalability, and performance of applications.

### **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**

AWS offers **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to automatically distribute incoming traffic across EC2 instances. ELB supports three types of load balancers:

* **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model, suitable for advanced routing and microservices.
    
* **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Operates at Layer 4, perfect for high-throughput, low-latency applications.
    
* **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Basic load balancing at Layer 4, ideal for simpler needs.

## üéØ Today's Tasks

We'll complete the following steps to implement an Application Load Balancer:

---

### **Task 1: Launch EC2 Instances and Configure Apache**

1. **Launch Two EC2 Instances**
    
    * Open the **AWS Management Console**.
        
    * Navigate to **EC2 &gt; Instances** and click **Launch Instances**.
        
    * Use the **Ubuntu AMI** and select an appropriate instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` under the free tier).
        
2. **Configure User Data for Apache Installation**  
    Add the following script in the **User Data** section while launching each instance:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    apt update
    apt install -y apache2
    echo "<h1>Hello, my name is YOUR_NAME</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
    systemctl start apache2
    systemctl enable apache2
    ```
    
    * Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name for the **first instance**.
        
    * Modify the script for the **second instance**:
        
        ```bash
        echo "<h1>TrainWithShubham Community is Super Awesome :)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
        ```
        
3. **Test Your Instances**
    
    * Copy the **Public IP** of each EC2 instance.
        
    * Open a web browser, paste the IP, and verify that the content matches your configuration.

### **Task 2: Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

1. **Access Load Balancer Settings**
    
    * Go to **EC2 &gt; Load Balancers** and click **Create Load Balancer**.
        
    * Choose **Application Load Balancer** and configure:
        
        * **Name:** Give your ALB a name (e.g., `MyAppALB`).
            
        * **Scheme:** Internet-facing.
            
        * **Listeners:** Keep the default HTTP listener on port 80.
            
        * **Availability Zones:** Select the zones where your EC2 instances are running.
            
2. **Set Up Target Groups**
    
    * Under **Target Groups**, create a new group:
        
        * **Target Type:** Instances.
            
        * **Protocol:** HTTP.
            
        * Add the EC2 instances from **Task 1** to the target group.
            
3. **Verify ALB Configuration**
    
    * Wait until the **Health Status** of your targets turns **healthy**.
        
    * Access the **DNS name** of the ALB in your browser to verify load balancing.
        
    * Refresh the page multiple times to see traffic alternate between the two EC2 instances.

## üìù Key Takeaways

* **Load Balancing** improves application reliability and performance.
    
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** provides advanced routing and is ideal for modern, distributed architectures.
    
* Setting up an ALB requires configuring EC2 instances, a target group, and verifying health checks.
