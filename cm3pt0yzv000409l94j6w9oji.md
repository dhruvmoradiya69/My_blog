### **Today's Task**

We‚Äôll set up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor your billing and notify you via email when the cost exceeds $2. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll cover:

1. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm**
    
2. **Send Notifications via SNS**
    
3. **Delete the Billing Alarm**

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1\. Create a CloudWatch Alarm for Billing**

* **Requirement:** Ensure billing alerts are enabled in your AWS account.
    
* Go to the **CloudWatch** console.
    
* Select **Billing** under metrics (use the **Billing metric namespace**).
    
* Choose the metric **EstimatedCharges**.
    
* Set a threshold: `$2` (you can adjust this based on your budget).
    
* Configure the alarm to trigger when the threshold is breached.
    

**Tip:** Make sure your AWS region supports billing alarms (usually, this is only available in the `US East (N. Virginia)` region).

---

#### **2\. Send Notifications via SNS**

* **Requirement:** Create an SNS topic to receive notifications.
    
* Go to the **SNS** console and create a new topic (e.g., `BillingAlertsTopic`).
    
* Add an email subscription to the topic.
    
* Confirm the subscription via the email link sent to your inbox.
    
* Link the SNS topic to your CloudWatch alarm during the alarm setup.
    

**Pro Tip:** Use an easily accessible email address so you never miss important notifications.

---

#### **3\. Delete the Billing Alarm**

* Navigate to the **CloudWatch** console.
    
* Go to the **Alarms** section.
    
* Select the billing alarm you created.
    
* Click **Delete** to remove it.
    

**Why Delete?** This helps you practice managing alarms and ensures you don‚Äôt get unnecessary notifications during testing.
