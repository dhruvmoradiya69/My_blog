## **What is Grafana?**

Grafana is an open-source platform for data visualization, monitoring, and observability. It lets you create customizable dashboards to visualize metrics from various data sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and InfluxDB. Itâ€™s widely used for monitoring infrastructure, applications, and business processes.

## **How to Set Up Grafana on AWS EC2**

Follow these steps to get Grafana running on an EC2 instance:

### **Step 1: Launch an AWS EC2 Instance**

1. Log in to your AWS Management Console.
    
2. Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard**.
    
3. Click **Launch Instance** and configure:
    
    * **AMI:** Choose Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu.
        
    * **Instance Type:** Select a free-tier eligible type, such as `t2.micro`.
        
    * **Key Pair:** Create or use an existing key pair for SSH access.
        
    * **Security Group:** Open ports `22` (SSH) and `3000` (Grafana default port).
        
4. Click **Launch** to start the instance.

### **Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance**

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
    
2. Use the following SSH command to connect:
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
    ```
    
3. Replace `your-key.pem` with your key file and `your-ec2-public-ip` with the instanceâ€™s public IP address.

### **Step 3: Install Grafana**

1. Update the system packages:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y   # For Ubuntu
    sudo yum update -y                       # For Amazon Linux
    ```
    
2. Add the Grafana repository and install Grafana:
    
    * For Ubuntu:
        
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
        sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y grafana
        ```
        
    * For Amazon Linux:
        
        ```bash
        sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/grafana.repo <<-'EOF'
        [grafana]
        name=grafana
        baseurl=https://packages.grafana.com/oss/rpm
        repo_gpgcheck=1
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key
        EOF
        sudo yum install grafana -y
        ```

### **Step 4: Start and Enable Grafana**

1. Start the Grafana service:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start grafana-server
    ```
    
2. Enable Grafana to start on boot:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
    ```
    
3. Check the service status to ensure itâ€™s running:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status grafana-server
    ```

### **Step 5: Access Grafana**

1. Open a browser on your local machine.
    
2. Navigate to [`http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000`](http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000).
    
3. Log in with the default credentials:
    
    * Username: `admin`
        
    * Password: `admin`
        
4. Change the default password as prompted for security reasons.
