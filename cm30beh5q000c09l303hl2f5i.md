Hey there, awesome readers! 👋 Today we're going to talk about something super cool in the Jenkins world - Agents! Don't worry if you're new to this; I'll break it down in a way that's easy to understand. Let's dive in!

## 🎯 What's Jenkins Master? Think of it as Your Project's Command Center!

Imagine you're running a busy restaurant kitchen:

* The Head Chef (Jenkins Master) plans all the meals 📋
    
* They organize the menu (workflows)
    
* They keep an eye on all the cooking (monitoring)
    
* They make sure everything runs smoothly (management)
    

## 👥 What's a Jenkins Agent? Your Helpful Kitchen Staff!

Just like a restaurant can't run with just one chef, Jenkins needs help too! That's where Agents come in:

* They're like your skilled cooks 👨‍🍳
    
* Each one can handle different tasks
    
* They work under the Head Chef's direction
    
* They can specialize in different types of "dishes" (tasks)
    

## 🌱 Why Do You Need Agents?

Think of it this way:

* Starting small? One kitchen (Jenkins server) might be enough
    
* Business growing? 📈 You'll need more hands on deck!
    
* More projects = More helpers needed
    
* Agents help share the workload, just like having multiple cooks in different stations
    

## 🛠️ Setting Things Up: The Basics

Before you get started, you'll need:

* A fresh computer (Ubuntu 22.04) for your new agent
    
* Some basic tools installed (Java and Docker)
    
* Proper permissions (like giving your staff the right keys to the kitchen! 🔑)
    

## 📝 Task 1: Creating Your First Jenkins Agent

### Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance 🚀

1. Go to AWS Console &gt; EC2 &gt; Launch Instance
    
    ```bash
    Name: jenkins-agent-1
    OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    Instance type: t2.micro (free tier)
    Key pair: Create new key pair if you don't have one
    Security Group Settings:
    - Allow SSH (Port 22)
    - Allow Custom TCP (Port 8080)
    ```
    
2. Click "Launch Instance" and wait for it to start
    

### Step 2: Set Up Your Agent Machine 🖥️

Connect to your EC2 instance:

```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-ip
```

Install required tools:

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Java (same version as Jenkins master)
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y

# Install Docker
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# Create Jenkins user
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash jenkins
sudo mkdir -p /home/jenkins/.ssh
```

### Step 3: Set Up SSH Keys 🔑

On your Jenkins master server:

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "jenkins-master"

# View public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

On your agent machine:

```bash
# Add master's public key to authorized_keys
sudo vim /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Paste the public key here

# Set correct permissions
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /home/jenkins/.ssh
sudo chmod 700 /home/jenkins/.ssh
sudo chmod 600 /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 4: Configure Agent in Jenkins UI 🎯

1. Open Jenkins dashboard
    
2. Go to `Manage Jenkins` &gt; `Manage Nodes and Clouds`
    
3. Click `New Node`
    
4. Fill in the details:
    
    ```basic
    name: Agent-1
    Type: Permanent Agent
    
    # Configuration
    Remote root directory: /home/jenkins
    Labels: ubuntu-agent docker-agent
    Launch method: Launch agents via SSH
    Host: Your-EC2-IP
    Credentials: Add > SSH Username with private key
    Host Key Verification Strategy: Non verifying
    ```
    
5. Click `Save`
    

### Step 5: Verify Connection ✅

1. Check agent status in `Manage Jenkins` &gt; `Manage Nodes and Clouds`
    
2. Your agent should show as "Connected"
    
3. Check logs if you see any issues

## 📝 Task 2: Running Jobs on Your New Agent

### Step 1: Modify Your Previous Pipeline 🔄

Open your previous pipeline from [***<mark>Day 26</mark>***](https://dhruvmoradiya.hashnode.dev/day-26-jenkins-declarative-pipeline) ***<mark> / </mark>*** [***<mark>Day27</mark>***](https://dhruvmoradiya.hashnode.dev/day-27-jenkins-declarative-pipeline-with-docker) and add agent specification:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent {
        label 'ubuntu-agent'  // This will run on our new agent
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Your existing build steps
                sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
            }
        }
        // Other stages...
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Agent Labels 🏷️

1. Go to your job configuration
    
2. Under "Restrict where this project can be run"
    
3. Enter `ubuntu-agent` or `docker-agent`
    
4. Save configuration
    

### Step 3: Test Your Setup 🧪

1. Run your pipeline
    
2. Check Console Output to verify it's running on the agent
    
3. Monitor agent's system resources
    

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Tips

Having issues? Check these common problems:

### Connection Issues 🔌

```bash
# On agent:
sudo service ssh status
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log

# On master:
ssh -i private_key jenkins@agent-ip
```

### Permission Issues 📝

```bash
# On agent:
ls -la /home/jenkins
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /home/jenkins
```

### Docker Issues 🐳

```bash
# On agent:
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo service docker status
docker ps  # Test docker access
```
