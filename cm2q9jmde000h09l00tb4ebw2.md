## Questions:

1. **What is the difference between an Image, Container, and Engine?**
    
    * **Image:** Consider an image to be like a house's blueprint. It is equipped with all the needed tools for a running application such as code, libraries, and dependencies.
        
    * **Container:** It is like the actual house that could be built from that blue print. It runs images in an isolated environment. Multiple containers can be operated by the same image.
        
    * **Engine:** The Docker engine is the builder and manager of these houses (containers). It is the software responsible for creating, running, and managing the containers.
        
2. **What is the difference between the Docker command COPY vs ADD?**
    
    * **COPY:** This is an easy command which copies files or directories from the local machine into the Docker image.
        
    * **ADD:** Besides copying files, ADD can also handle URLs and automatically unpack compressed files such as.tar [or.zip](http://or.zip). Use ADD when you require those features; otherwise stick to COPY for clarity.
        
3. **What is the difference between the Docker command CMD vs RUN?**
    
    * **RUN:** This command runs while building images. It does a thing and commits the results to the image. For example, `RUN apt-get install -y python3` installs Python in the image.
        
    * **CMD:** This one is defining a default command to execute at container run time. It does not run as part of build time. Example: `CMD ["python3", "`[`app.py`](http://app.py)`"]` says that during container execution, it should start running what's in `app.py`.
        
4. **How will you reduce the size of a Docker image?**
    
    * Use a smaller base image, such as an alpine instead of ubuntu.
        
    * Combine multiple RUN commands into one (to minimize layers).
        
    * Clean out temporary files in one command that creates them.
        
    * Keep images lean, like not having extra files like local development files.
        
5. Why and when should you use Docker?
    
    * Use Docker when you want an assurance that your application performs identically in development, testing, and production. It is a good match for microservices architectures and simple to deploy applications into the cloud.
        
6. Explain the Docker components and how they interact with each other.
    
    * **Docker Client:** This command line interface (CLI) with which you interact to communicate with the Docker daemon (engine).
        
    * **Docker Daemon:** This is a background service running on your machine, managing images, containers, networks, and volumes.
        
    * Docker Registry: where Docker images are stored, such as Docker Hub. The daemon downloads images from the registry for using on a container.
        
7. Explain the terminology: Docker Compose, Dockerfile, Docker Image, Docker Container.
    
    * Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a single `docker-compose.yml` file.
        
    * Dockerfile: A textual document containing directives for creating a Docker image. It is a description of the configuration procedure.
        
    * Docker Image: This is a read only template. It contains everything needed to build the application in containers.
        
    * Docker Container: A running instance based on a Docker image. It includes the application along with its required dependencies.
        
8. In what real scenarios have you used Docker?
    
    * I used Docker to containerize a web application for a project. This technology allowed my team to run our application on multiple machines without worrying about inconsistencies in the environment. Every developer had the same setup, which made collaboration a bit smoother.
        
9. Docker vs Hypervisor?
    
    * Docker is light and utilizes the host's operating system kernel, which makes it faster and uses less memory. Hypervisors create virtual machines that have a full operating system, so there is more overhead. Use Docker for applications that need to be deployed quickly and scaled easily.
        
10. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Docker?
    
    * **Advantages**:
        
        * Portability: Run containers on any system that supports Docker.
            
        * Isolation: Every container works in its own space.
            
        * Version Control: Easily track changes and roll back if needed.
            
    * **Disadvantages**:
        
        * Complexity: Steep learning curve for newcomers to containerization.
            
        * Security: Containers share the host kernel, which can be a concern if not configured properly.
            
11. What is a Docker namespace?
    
    * Namespaces provide isolation to a container. Containers receive, for processes, users as well as network interface naming, their own namespace, which creates no conflict between themselves.
        
12. What is a Docker registry?
    
    * A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. The default Docker registry is Docker Hub where you can get and share images publicly or privately.
        
13. What is an entry point?
    
    * This is the command to run if a container is run. This facility enables one to declare a fixed command not overridden by default on execution of the container for predictable behavior.
        
14. How to implement CI/CD in Docker?
    
    * Make images of your application using Docker in the CI/CD pipeline. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used to auto-make the Docker image, run tests, and send it to production.
        
15. Will data on the container be lost when the Docker container exits?
    
    * Yes, except for using a volume or a bind mount to retain data. Any changes you make to the filesystem of a container are lost when the container stops.
        
16. What is a Docker swarm?
    
    * Docker Swarm is a tool that aggregates and orchestrates many Docker containers scattered across different computers. Applications are, therefore, much bigger, and work distribution is automatically managed.
        
17. What are the Docker commands for the following:
    
    * Viewing running containers: `docker ps`
        
    * Running a container under a specific name: `docker run --name my_container_name my_image`
        
    * Exporting a Docker image: `docker save -o my_image.tar my_image`
        
    * Importing an existing Docker image: `docker load -i my_image.tar`
        
    * Deleting a container: `docker rm my_container`
        
    * Removing all stopped containers, unused networks, build caches, and dangling images?
        
        * `docker system prune`
            
18. What are the common Docker practices to reduce the size of Docker images?
    
    * Begin from an empty base image, do multi-stage builds, and clean up caches avoid adding in unnecessary packages.
        
19. How do you troubleshoot a Docker container that is not starting?
    
    * Now check the container logs with the help of `docker logs <container_id>`. It can show any error messages, the running state of the application, and whether all needed services or dependencies are in place.
        
20. Can you explain the Docker networking model?
    
    * Docker uses different types of networks (bridge, host, overlay). The bridge network is the default, allowing containers to communicate on the same host. The host network shares the host’s networking stack, while overlay networks allow communication between containers across multiple hosts in a swarm.
        
21. How do you manage persistent storage in Docker?
    
    * Docker volumes keep your data outside of the container filesystem. That is, even if you remove the container, your data stays safe. Besides that, you can use bind mounts to access files directly on the host.
        
22. How do you secure a Docker container?
    
    * Running the container at the lowest privilege, Using a user namespace, Checking vulnerabilities of images, and Updating Docker. Avoid running unnecessary services inside a container.
        
23. What is Docker overlay networking?
    
    * Overlay networking allows containers spread across multiple Docker hosts talk to each other as if they were on the same network-a pretty useful feature for the design of multi-host setups in a Docker Swarm.
        
24. How do you handle environment variables in Docker?
    
    * Environment variables would have been propagated to containers through the `-e` flag off running a container, defined within a Docker file through the use of the `ENV` instruction, or defined within a Docker Compose file.
