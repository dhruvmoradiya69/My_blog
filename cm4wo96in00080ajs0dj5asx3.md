## **What Databases Work with Grafana?**

Grafana seamlessly integrates with numerous databases and data sources, including:

* **Time-Series Databases:** Prometheus, InfluxDB, OpenTSDB.
    
* **SQL Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server.
    
* **Cloud Providers:** AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, Azure Monitor.
    
* **NoSQL Databases:** Elasticsearch, MongoDB.
    

The wide compatibility ensures you can visualize data from almost any resource you manage.

## **What Are Metrics and Visualizations in Grafana?**

### Metrics:

Metrics are numerical data points gathered from your systems over time. For instance, CPU usage percentages, memory consumption, or the number of HTTP requests handled by a server.

### Visualizations:

Visualizations represent these metrics graphically, making them easier to interpret. Grafana offers:

* **Graphs:** Track trends over time.
    
* **Heatmaps:** Visualize density and distribution.
    
* **Tables:** Present tabular data for comparison.
    
* **Bar Gauges:** Highlight current values in context.
    

These visualizations help you quickly grasp the state of your systems.

## **Grafana vs. Prometheus: Key Differences**

Grafana and Prometheus are often used together but serve different purposes. Letâ€™s break it down:

| **Feature** | **Grafana** | **Prometheus** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Visualization and dashboard creation | Metrics collection and storage |
| **Data Storage** | Does not store data; queries data sources | Stores metrics in its time-series database |
| **Alerting** | Visual alerting based on thresholds | Built-in alert manager |
| **Integration** | Compatible with various databases | Works primarily as a data source for Grafana |

In short, **Prometheus** collects and stores data, while **Grafana** visualizes it. Together, they create a robust monitoring solution.

    * Use Docker for a quick setup: `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana`
        
2. **Connect a Data Source:**
    
    * Log in to Grafana at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) (default credentials: admin/admin).
        
    * Go to **Configuration &gt; Data Sources** and add a source, e.g., Prometheus.
        
3. **Create a Dashboard:**
    
    * Click on **Dashboards &gt; New Dashboard**.
        
    * Add a panel and select metrics to visualize.
        
4. **Set Alerts:**
    
    * Define thresholds for critical metrics.
        
    * Integrate notification channels like email or Slack.
        

By completing this task, youâ€™ll have a functional Grafana instance monitoring your resources in no time!
