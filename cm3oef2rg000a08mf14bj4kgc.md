Over 30% of websites on the internet use WordPress, making it one of the most popular Content Management Systems (CMS). While WordPress is commonly used for blogs, it can also power e-commerce platforms, forums, and various other types of sites. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through how to deploy a WordPress site on AWS, leveraging its scalability and reliability.

### **What Youâ€™ll Learn**

* Set up the infrastructure required for a WordPress site.
    
* Deploy and configure WordPress on an EC2 instance.
    
* Create and connect a MySQL database using Amazon RDS.
    

---

### **Resources to Be Created**

1. **Amazon EC2 instance** â€“ To install and host the WordPress application.
    
2. **Amazon RDS for MySQL** â€“ To store WordPress data.
    

Letâ€™s dive into the step-by-step process.

### **Task 01: Set Up the MySQL Database (Amazon RDS)**

WordPress requires a MySQL database to store its content, such as posts, pages, and user data. Follow these steps to create an RDS database:

#### **Steps to Create RDS:**

1. **Login to AWS Management Console:**  
    Navigate to the **Amazon RDS** service.
    
2. **Create a Database Instance:**
    
    * Choose the **Standard Create** option.
        
    * Engine: Select **MySQL**.
        
    * Version: Choose the latest **MySQL-compatible version**.
        
3. **Configure Database Settings:**
    
    * **DB Instance Class:** Choose a class such as `db.t2.micro` for a low-cost option.
        
    * **Storage:** Use 20 GB of General Purpose (SSD).
        
    * **DB Identifier:** Name your database, e.g., `wordpress-db`.
        
    * **Credentials:** Set a master username (e.g., `admin`) and password (save these for later).
        
4. **Network and Security Settings:**
    
    * **VPC:** Ensure itâ€™s in the same VPC as your EC2 instance.
        
    * **Public Access:** Enable **Yes** (if needed for testing, but restrict for production).
        
    * Add a security group allowing MySQL traffic (`port 3306`).
        
5. **Create the Database:**  
    Click **Create Database** and wait for the instance to be provisioned.

### **Task 02: Set Up the WordPress Server on Amazon EC2**

Now that your database is ready, letâ€™s set up the server to host your WordPress application.

#### **Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance:**

1. **Login to AWS Management Console:**  
    Navigate to the **Amazon EC2** service.
    
2. **Launch an Instance:**
    
    * Choose the **Amazon Linux 2 AMI** or **Ubuntu AMI**.
        
    * Select an instance type like `t2.micro` (eligible for free tier).
        
    * Configure **Key Pair:** Download and save a key pair for SSH access.
        
3. **Network Settings:**
    
    * Assign the instance to the same VPC and subnet as your RDS database.
        
    * Add a security group allowing traffic on **HTTP (80)** and **SSH (22)**.
        
4. **Connect to Your EC2 Instance:**
    
    * Use SSH to connect:
        
        ```bash
        ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
        ```
        

---

### **Task 03: Install WordPress and Dependencies**

After connecting to the EC2 instance, install the required software to host WordPress.

#### **Install LAMP Stack:**

1. Update packages:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum update -y
    ```
    
2. Install Apache:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    ```
    
3. Install PHP:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y php php-mysqlnd
    ```
    
4. Install MySQL client:
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y mysql
    ```
    

#### **Download and Configure WordPress:**

1. Download WordPress:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
    tar -xvf latest.tar.gz
    ```
    
2. Move WordPress files to the web directory:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mv wordpress/* /var/www/html/
    ```
    
3. Set permissions:
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/
    ```

### **Task 04: Configure WordPress**

1. **Create the** `wp-config.php` File:  
    Rename and edit the sample config file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo cp /var/www/html/wp-config-sample.php /var/www/html/wp-config.php
    sudo nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php
    ```
    
2. **Edit Database Settings in** `wp-config.php`:
    
    * Update the database name, user, and password fields to match your RDS setup:
        
        ```php
        define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress-db');
        define('DB_USER', 'admin');
        define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your-password');
        define('DB_HOST', 'your-rds-endpoint');
        ```
        
3. Restart Apache:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart httpd
    ```

### **Task 05: Access Your WordPress Site**

1. **Get the Public IP of Your EC2 Instance:**  
    Find the public IP in the AWS EC2 dashboard.
    
2. **Visit Your WordPress Site:**  
    Open your browser and go to:
    
    ```bash
    http://your-ec2-public-ip
    ```
    
3. **Complete the WordPress Installation Wizard:**
    
    * Choose your language.
        
    * Enter site title, admin username, password, and email.
        
    * Click **Install WordPress**.

### **Key Points to Remember**

* Ensure proper security group configurations to allow traffic between EC2 and RDS.
    
* Keep your database credentials and key pair secure.
    
* Always terminate unnecessary resources after testing to avoid extra charges.
